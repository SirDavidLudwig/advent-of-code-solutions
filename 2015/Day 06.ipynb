    "<h2>--- Day 6: Probably a Fire Hazard ---</h2><p>Because your neighbors keep defeating you in the holiday house decorating contest year after year, you've decided to deploy one million lights in a <span title=\"Hey, be glad I'm not asking for the resistance between two points!\">1000x1000 grid</span>.</p>\n",
    "<p>Furthermore, because you've been especially nice this year, Santa has mailed you instructions on how to display the ideal lighting configuration.</p>\n",
    "<p>Lights in your grid are numbered from 0 to 999 in each direction; the lights at each corner are at <code>0,0</code>, <code>0,999</code>, <code>999,999</code>, and <code>999,0</code>. The instructions include whether to <code>turn on</code>, <code>turn off</code>, or <code>toggle</code> various inclusive ranges given as coordinate pairs.  Each coordinate pair represents opposite corners of a rectangle, inclusive; a coordinate pair like <code>0,0 through 2,2</code> therefore refers to 9 lights in a 3x3 square.  The lights all start turned off.\n",
    "</p><p>To defeat your neighbors this year, all you have to do is set up your lights by doing the instructions Santa sent you in order.</p>\n",
    "<p>For example:</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li><code>turn on 0,0 through 999,999</code> would turn on (or leave on) every light.</li>\n",
    "<li><code>toggle 0,0 through 999,0</code> would toggle the first line of 1000 lights, turning off the ones that were on, and turning on the ones that were off.</li>\n",
    "<li><code>turn off 499,499 through 500,500</code> would turn off (or leave off) the middle four lights.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "<p>After following the instructions, <em style=\"color: #fff; text-shadow: 0 0 5px #fff;\">how many lights are lit</em>?</p>\n"
