    "<h2>--- Day 1: Not Quite Lisp ---</h2><p>Santa was hoping for a white Christmas, but his weather machine's \"snow\" function is powered by stars, and he's fresh out!  To save Christmas, he needs you to collect <em style=\"color: #ffff66; text-shadow: 0 0 5px #ffff66\">fifty stars</em> by December 25th.</p>\n",
    "<p>Collect stars by helping Santa solve puzzles.  Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first.  Each puzzle grants <em style=\"color: #ffff66; text-shadow: 0 0 5px #ffff66\">one star</em>. <span title=\"Also, some puzzles contain Easter eggs like this one. Yes, I know it's not traditional to do Advent calendars for Easter.\">Good luck!</span></p>\n",

    "<p>An opening parenthesis, <code>(</code>, means he should go up one floor, and a closing parenthesis, <code>)</code>, means he should go down one floor.</p>\n",
    "<p>The apartment building is very tall, and the basement is very deep; he will never find the top or bottom floors.</p>\n",
