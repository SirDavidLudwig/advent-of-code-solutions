    "\n",
    "Ahead of you is what appears to be a large ocean trench. Could the keys have fallen into it? You'd better send a probe to investigate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probe launcher on your submarine can fire the probe with any integer velocity in the `x` (forward) and `y` (upward, or downward if negative) directions. For example, an initial `x,y` velocity like `0,10` would fire the probe straight up, while an initial velocity like `10,-1` would fire the probe forward at a slight downward angle.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probe's `x,y` position starts at `0,0`. Then, it will follow some trajectory by moving in **steps**. On each step, these changes occur in the following order:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The probe's `x` position increases by its `x` velocity.\n",
    "- The probe's `y` position increases by its `y` velocity.\n",
    "- Due to drag, the probe's `x` velocity changes by `1` toward the value `0`; that is, it decreases by `1` if it is greater than `0`, increases by `1` if it is less than `0`, or does not change if it is already `0`.\n",
    "- Due to gravity, the probe's `y` velocity decreases by `1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the probe to successfully make it into the trench, the probe must be on some trajectory that causes it to be within a **target area** after any step. The submarine computer has already calculated this target area (your puzzle input). For example:\n",
